In this implementation, each fork is represented by a Fork struct that includes a mutex. Each philosopher is represented by a Philosopher struct that includes an ID, pointers to its left and right forks, and a pointer to the arbitrator.

The Arbitrator struct includes a slice of forks and a mutex. The requestForks() method acquires the arbitrator mutex and loops until both requested forks are available, then locks them. The releaseForks() method releases the forks and unlocks the arbitrator mutex.

The eat() method of the Philosopher struct calls the requestForks() method of the arbitrator to request its left and right forks, then eats for a random amount of time. The philosopher then calls the releaseForks() method of the arbitrator to release its forks.

In the main() function, the forks and arbitrator are initialized, and a wait group is created. A goroutine is started for each philosopher to call the eat() method, passing in the wait group. Finally, the wait group is waited on to ensure that all philosophers have finished eating before the program exits.
